Server tools:
 - consult_ollama: Consult an Ollama model with a prompt and get its response for reasoning from another viewpoint.
 - list_ollama_models: List all available Ollama models on the local instance.
 - compare_ollama_models: Run the same prompt against multiple Ollama models and return their outputs side-by-side for comparison.

Calling 'list_ollama_models'...
list_ollama_models result:
 Available models: glm-4.6:cloud, gemma3:4b, gpt-oss:20b-cloud, deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud, gpt-oss:120b-cloud, qwen3-coder:480b-cloud
Using model "glm-4.6:cloud" for consult_ollama (best-effort).

 While Rust offers safety benefits, rewriting coreutils is a monumental undertaking that risks breaking decades of stability. The current C versions are battle-tested, POSIX-compliant, and their every quirk is relied upon by systems and scripts worldwide. A full rewrite introduces new bugs and compatibility issues, suggesting that focused hardening of the existing code might be a more practical use of developer time.

Calling 'compare_ollama_models' to compare model outputs...
compare_ollama_models result:
 Model glm-4.6:cloud:
While Rust offers memory safety, the C implementation of coreutils has been battle-tested for decades, proving its immense stability and correctness. A full rewrite introduces a massive new surface for unknown bugs, effectively trading well-understood issues for new ones. The immense developer effort required could be more productively spent auditing and carefully improving the existing, trusted codebase.

Model gemma3:4b:
While Rust offers benefits like memory safety, rewriting coreutils presents significant risks. The existing C codebase is incredibly mature, highly optimized, and deeply ingrained in the Linux ecosystem – a wholesale rewrite would introduce immense testing and compatibility challenges.  Furthermore, the immense effort required could be better spent on incremental improvements and bug fixes within the existing C codebase, offering a more sustainable and reliable approach.
