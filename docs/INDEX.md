# Documentation Index

This folder collects the project's documentation into logical subfolders for easier navigation.

Subfolders:

- `architecture/` — architecture notes and diagrams
- `code_map/` — code maps and JSON reference files
- `guides/` — onboarding, quickstart, and how-to guides
- `examples/` — demos and example usage
- `timeout/` — notes and experiments about timeout handling
- `optimization/` — optimization notes and summaries
- `refactor/` — refactoring plans and progress
- `overhaul/` — overhaul notes and journeys
- `phase2/` — phase-2 related docs

If you want a different organization, edit this index and move files accordingly. Original files are preserved in `archive/` when applicable.
